This is a library to provide some common codes:


## ODataEndpointController.cs

You can copy/paste this controller to your project to debug the route table.

Just send `~/$odata`, you will get HTML tabel listing the routing endpoint info.

Alternatively, you can use `app.UseODataRouteDebug` middleware to get the similiar debug info.
